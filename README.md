# Better Server Browser
This mod aims to enhance the game's server browser menu. While the original menu is well-designed, certain details have been frustrating, such as :
- the cumbersome map and game mode filters, 
- the small join server button that doesn't encompass the entire text,
- the search server button overlapping the text entry. 

All these elements have been fixed, along with the addition of new filters and a revamped server details panel.
