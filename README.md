# Better Server Browser
This mod aims to enhance the game's server browser menu. While the original menu is well-designed, certain details have been frustrating, such as :
- the cumbersome map and game mode filters, 
- the small join server button that doesn't encompass the entire text,
- the search server button overlapping the text entry. 

All these elements have been fixed, along with the addition of new filters and a revamped server details panel.

### Interesting thing to know:
- The scroll bar (for the server details) automatically hides and appears as needed.
- The search entry automatically resizes its width to fit the text inside the label.

- Now, if you left-click on the Server description or required mod, you can scroll up and down to navigate through the displayed text, if it's possible.
